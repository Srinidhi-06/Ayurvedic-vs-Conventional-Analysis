# Ayurvedic-vs-Conventional-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents a comparative data science analysis between Ayurvedic medicine and Conventional (Allopathic) medicine.  
The key highlight of this project is the creation of custom datasets through manual data collection and complete end-to-end analysis.

The study is based entirely on real-world data and does not use any public or pre-existing datasets.

## Dataset Creation
The datasets were manually scraped and curated from multiple online sources.

### Key Points
- No public or pre-existing datasets were used
- Data was collected manually
- Separate datasets were created for Ayurvedic and Conventional medicine

### Data Sources
- Twitter
- YouTube comments
- Medical and healthcare websites
- Online medical shopping platforms
- User reviews and testimonials

## Data Science and Analysis
The following data science techniques were applied to both datasets:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Text processing
- Sentiment analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Comparative statistical analysis
- Data visualization

### Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Basic NLP techniques

## Notebook Description
Each Jupyter notebook in this repository represents different stages of the project:

- Dataset preparation
- Individual analysis of Ayurvedic medicine
- Individual analysis of Conventional medicine
- Comparative analysis and insights

## Key Findings

### Ayurvedic Medicine
- Higher positive sentiment
- Fewer mentions of side effects
- Better acceptance for long-term usage
- Strong trust in natural treatment approaches

### Conventional Medicine
- Faster short-term relief
- Higher frequency of side-effect mentions
- Greater dependency for chronic conditions

## Conclusion
Based on data-driven analysis, Ayurvedic medicine demonstrated better overall performance, particularly in terms of safety perception, long-term effectiveness, and user satisfaction.
