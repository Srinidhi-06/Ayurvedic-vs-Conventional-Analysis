Ayurvedic-vs-Conventional-Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on a comparative data science analysis between Ayurvedic medicine and Conventional (Allopathic) medicine.

The key highlight of this work is that:

We created our own datasets manually

Performed end-to-end data analytics

Studied effectiveness, public sentiment, and overall perception

Unlike typical projects that rely on ready-made datasets, this study is built entirely on real-world data collected from multiple platforms.

📊 Dataset Creation

No public or pre-existing datasets were used

Datasets were manually scraped and curated

Data Sources

Social media platforms (Twitter, YouTube comments)

Medical and health-related websites

Online medical shopping platforms
