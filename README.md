# Ayurvedic-vs-Conventional-Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on a comparative data science analysis between Ayurvedic medicine and Conventional (Allopathic) medicine.
The key highlight of this work is that we created our own datasets manually and performed end-to-end data analytics to study effectiveness, public sentiment, and overall perception.

Unlike typical projects that rely on ready-made datasets, this study is built entirely on real-world data collected from multiple platforms.
